# F1 Fantasy Model
The following repository deploys a Genetic Algorithm (GA) to develop a F1 Fantasy Team optimized for maximum performance within a given budget amount. The team are developmed using F1 driver and constructors prices, along with the weekly budget constraints, given on the F1 Fanstasy [website](https://fantasy.formula1.com/en/create-team).

## Developer's Notes
Thank you for visting my GA-powered F1 Fantasy team development repository. My goal with this repository is use different optimization techniques for the unique challenges exhibited in developing the best F1 fantasy team on every race-week basis. 

I am also using this repository as a testbed to work on tuning my coding methods and exploring new ways of incoporating features that may be used in creating fantasy teams, such as recommending Wild Card, Mega Driver or Turbo Driver, and any other features that are available for competitors.

Cheers,
